# What are those?

Those are native Android libraries meant to be loaded into the guest environment,
and the come from a [prebuilt AOSP image provided by google](https://ci.android.com/builds/branches/aosp-main/grid).

# What are these files for then?

They provide a similar-to-android implementation to all of the supported libraries,
allowing us to make less guesswork, and provide more accurate renditions of a lot
of those functionalities, specially for libc++ where a lot of guesswork was done
in the past.

OpenAL, OpenGL and libc.so are provided from the host (via thunking where needed) or
via reimplementations.

You still need a suitable GameMaker Android title/runner. You can source those from
either [freeware Android APKs](https://itch.io) or finding a [suitable runner](https://gamemaker.io/account/runtimes) for hacking.
